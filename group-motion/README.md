# Group Motion - Location-Based Challenge App ðŸŽ¯

A mobile application that turns real-world locations into interactive challenge zones where users can complete various motion-based tasks and earn rewards.

## Overview

Group Motion is an MVP for a location-based challenges app that encourages social interaction and physical activity through gamified challenges at specific locations. The app combines real-world locations with motion detection technology to create an engaging experience.

## Features

- **Location-Based Challenges**: Find and complete challenges at specific locations
- **Motion Detection**: Uses device camera and TensorFlow.js to detect and validate challenge completion
- **Social Gaming**: Best played in pairs where one person films while the other performs the challenge
- **Reward System**: Earn NFT rewards for completing challenges
- **Real-World Examples**:
  - 10 pushups outside London Bridge
  - Compliment 10 people outside New Cross
  - High five 5 people at Heathrow Airport

## How It Works

1. **Find Challenges**: Browse nearby challenges based on your location
2. **Team Up**: The app is designed for pair play:
   - One person films the challenge
   - The other person performs the required motion
3. **Complete Challenges**: Use the device camera to validate motion completion
4. **Earn Rewards**: Both participants receive NFT rewards upon successful completion

## Technical Stack
